# 21B. Specialty IPA: White IPA

## Overall Impression

A fruity, spicy, refreshing version of an American IPA, but with a lighter color, less body, and featuring the distinctive yeast or spice additions typical of a Witbier.

## Appearance

Pale to deep golden color. Typically hazy. Moderate to large, dense white head that persists.

## Aroma

Moderate esters, often orange, grapefruit, apricot, or sometimes banana. Light spices optional, usually coriander, orange peel, pepper, or clove. Medium-low to medium hop aroma, often stone fruit, citrus, or tropical fruit. Esters and spices may reduce perception of hop aroma. Low neutral, grainy, or bready malt. Light alcohol aroma optional.

## Flavor

Moderate to high esters, medium-low to medium-high hop flavor, and light spices, all with the same descriptors as aroma. Light malt flavor, perhaps a bit bready. High bitterness. Moderately dry, refreshing finish. Background alcohol flavor optional.

## Mouthfeel

Medium-light body. Medium to medium-high carbonation. Light spice astringency optional. Low warmth optional.

## Comments

A craft beer interpretation of American IPA crossed with a Witbier. Spice impression may come from Belgian yeast, spice additions, or both.

## History

American craft brewers developed the style as a late winter or spring seasonal beer to appeal to Witbier and IPA drinkers alike.

## Characteristic Ingredients

Pale and wheat malts, Belgian Witbier yeast, citrusy American type hops. Coriander and orange peel optional.

## Style Comparison

Bitter, hoppy, and stronger like an American IPA but fruity, spicy, and light like a Witbier. Typically late hops are not as prominent as in American IPA.
