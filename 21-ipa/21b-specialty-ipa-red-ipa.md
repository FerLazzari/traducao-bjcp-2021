## 21B. Specialty IPA: Red IPA

### Overall Impression

Hoppy, bitter, and moderately strong like an American IPA, but with some caramel, toffee, or fruit character as in an American Amber Ale. Retaining the dryish finish and lean body that makes IPAs so drinkable, a Red IPA is a little more flavorful and malty than an American IPA without being sweet or heavy.

### Appearance

Color ranging from light reddish-amber to dark reddish-copper. Clear. Light haze optional. Medium-sized, off-white to cream-colored head with good persistence.

### Aroma

Moderate to strong hop aroma, often with a stone fruit, tropical fruit, citrus, resin, pine, berry, or melon character. Medium-low to medium malty-sweet aroma mixes in well with the hop selection, and often features medium to dark caramel, toffee, toasted bread, or dark fruit character. Clean fermentation profile. Light esters optional. Light alcohol aroma optional.

### Flavor

Medium to very high hop flavor, same descriptors as aroma. Medium-low to medium clean, supportive malty flavor with same descriptors as aroma. The malt and hop choices should not produce flavor clashes. Medium-high to very high bitterness, no harshness. Dry to medium finish, with a bitter, hoppy, and malty aftertaste. Low esters optional. Very low alcohol flavor optional. The malt should not overshadow the hop flavor and bitterness in the balance.

### Mouthfeel

Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harshness. Light warmth optional.

### Comments

Separated from American Amber Ale to better differentiate stronger, highly hopped examples from more balanced, standard-strength beers.

### History

A modern American craft beer style, based on American IPA but with the malt flavors of an American Amber Ale. See American Amber Ale.

### Characteristic Ingredients

Similar to an American IPA, but with medium or dark crystal malts, possibly some character malts with a light toasty aspect. May use sugar adjuncts. Any American or New World hop character is acceptable, but the hops and character malts should not clash.

### Style Comparison

A stronger, hoppier, more bitter version of American Amber Ale. Not as malty and sweet as an American Strong Ale. Drier, less alcohol, and not as malty as American Barleywine. Less chocolate and caramel than Brown IPA, but otherwise similar balance.
