## 21B. Specialty IPA: Rye IPA

### Overall Impression

An American IPA with spicy, grainy rye malt. The rye gives a bready and peppery flavor, a creamier body, and a dry, grainy finish.

### Appearance

Color ranging from medium gold to light reddish-amber. Clear. Light haze optional. Medium-sized, white to off-white head with good persistence.

### Aroma

Prominent to intense hop aroma, often with a stone fruit, tropical fruit, citrus, resin, pine, berry, or melon character. Low peppery rye malt aroma, along with a clean, background grainy maltiness. Clean fermentation profile. Light esters optional. Light alcohol aroma optional.

### Flavor

Medium to very high hop flavor, same descriptors as aroma. Low to medium-low clean, supportive malt possibly with light caramel or toast flavors. Low to moderate grainy, peppery, spicy rye flavor that adds to the dry finish. Medium-high to very high bitterness, no harshness. Dry, bitter, hoppy aftertaste. Low esters optional. Background alcohol flavor optional.

### Mouthfeel

Medium-light to medium body. Smooth texture, may be lightly creamy. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harshness. Low warmth optional.

### Comments

A modern American craft beer variation of American IPA. Rye malt character should be noticeable, otherwise enter in 21A American IPA.

### History

A modern craft era variation of American IPA, popular among homebrewers.

### Characteristic Ingredients

Like an American IPA, with a generous portion of rye malt. Any American or New World hop is acceptable, but the hops and malt should not clash. No caraway. No oak.

### Style Comparison

Drier, slightly spicier, and slightly creamier than an American IPA, with more of a lingering bitterness and spiciness in the finish. Does not have the intense rye malt or Weizen yeast character of a Roggenbier.
