## 34A. Commercial Specialty Beer

### Overall Impression

Based on declared beer.

### Aroma / Appearance / Flavor / Mouthfeel

Based on declared beer.

### Comments

Intended as a catch-all location for specific beers that are based on unique commercial examples that donâ€™t fit existing styles. Past versions of the Style Guidelines included a Belgian Specialty Ale style; this style fits that general purpose, as well as allowing non-Belgian entries of similar intent.

### Entry Instructions

The entrant must specify the name of the commercial beer, specifications (vital statistics) for the beer, and either a brief sensory description or a list of ingredients used in making the beer. Without this information, judges who are unfamiliar with the beer will have no basis for comparison.

### Vital Statistics

OG, FG, IBUs, SRM and ABV will vary depending on the declared beer.

### Commercial Examples

Orval, La Chouffe.

### Past Revision

Clone Beer (2015)
